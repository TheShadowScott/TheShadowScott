Hello there!
Most of my personal computer projects are in the following languages, but I, for whatever reason, feel a consistent need to increase those that I can partly read:
1. C# / F#
2. JavaScript (Web) & Node.JS
3. Python


I also love learning random information! Feel free to contact me [here](mailto://smpendland@null.net), or check out my [socials](https://scottpendland.com/links.html).
