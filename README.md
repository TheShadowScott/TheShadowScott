Hello there!
I'm [@TheShadowScott](https://github.com/TheShadowScott), and as you can tell I write wonderfully _crappy_ code!
I currently understand at lest _some_ (but I may or may not be fluent in), the following computing languages:
1. C#
2. JavaScript (Web) & Node.JS
3. Python
4. R
5. Perl


I also love learning random information! Feel free to contact me [here](mailto://smpendland@null.net), or check out my [socials](https://scottpendland.com/links.html).
